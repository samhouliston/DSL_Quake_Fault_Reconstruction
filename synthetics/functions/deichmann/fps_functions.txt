  fpsml(finam,strike1,dip1,rake1,txt)
 
  Function to plot first motion polarities and focal mechanisms on a
  stereo-net (lower hemisphere, equal area, with radius = 1).
  Input:
  finam:  filename of nonlinloc output (.MANUPDE format)
          (if not available, give ' ' (one blank character) instead)
  strike1,dip1,rake1: strike, dip and rake of one nodal plane
          (if not given, only first motions will be plotted)
  txt:    'n' = no text on plot; 'y' = station names and parameters on plot
          (default is 'y').
 
  fpsml computes strike,dip and rake of the second nodal plane as well as 
  P- and T-axes for the focal mechanism defined by strike1, dip1 and rake1. 
  If txt = 'y', the positions of the P- and T-axis are plotted as red 
  triangles.
 
  If both an input file with first motions as well as strike, dip and rake
  are given, the output will be written to file fpsml.txt and a summary
  line will be appended to file fpsml.log.
 
  fpsml calls the following other functions:
     pdeloc.m and pdestn.m to read the input data from the .MANUPDE file
     pcircle.m   to draw circle of stereo-net and first motion polarities
     equalarea.m to calculate x and y coordinates of points on stereo-net
     sdr2sdr.m   to compute strike, dip and rake of second nodal plane
     sdr2ptb.m   to compute azimuth and plunge of P-, T- and B-axes
     sd2xy.m     to draw the nodal planes on the stereo net
     faultregime.m to determine fault regime according to World Stress Map
     thetaphi.m  to compute take-off angles relative to normal and strike
     radpat.m    to compute radiation coefficients for P, SV and SH waves

  planes.
  Optional parameters are figure number (default 1), option to plot 
  P- and T-axes as red triangles (ptax = 'y' or 'n', default 'n') and

help sdr2sdr
 
      [strike2,dip2,rake2] = sdr2sdr(strike1,dip1,rake1);
 
      Given strike, dip and rake of a fault plane (1) calculate 
      strike, dip and rake of the conjugate fault plane (2).
      strike is measured counterclockwise from north,

      rake is measured in the plane relative to the strike (degrees).
 
      Assume a right-handed coordinate system: 1 = N, 2 = E, 3 = Z(down).

      The components of a unit-vector defined by azimuth, measured
      counterclockwise from north, and dip, measured downward from the
      horizontal, are then given by:
      c(1) = cos(dip) * cos(azim)
      c(2) = cos(dip) * sin(azim)
      c(3) = sin(dip)
